URL shortening
==============

Problem description
-------------------

People are frequently posting URLs using services that limit the length of a
message. They often use shorteners to fit more words into their messages, or do
so for other reasons, such as preventing a URL spanning multiple lines from
being split up and word-wrapped by email software, or just want to shorten
lengthy URLs (and http://lol.ca/ts is so much easier to post to Twitter than
http://www.laughing-out-loud.com/FelisSilvestrisCatus.aspx).

Your task is to build a user-facing web service that takes a URL and provides a
shorter URL, when possible. When resolved, that URL should redirect the user to
the original URL.

Requirements
------------

* Your solution should be written in Go
* The service should have a user-facing web site (but the graphical design
  won't matter)
* When given a long URL, the service should shorten it and return the
  shortened URL
* Visiting the shortened URL should redirect the visitor to the long URL
* You should provide source code as well as a link to a running
  instance of your service
* You do, of course, not need to register a short domain name
* Please include your thoughts on how to deploy your service in a production environment as well as how you would scale it to millions of users
